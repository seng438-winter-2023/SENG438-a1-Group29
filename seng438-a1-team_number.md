# Introduction

We understand that manual testing can be done in two different ways. Either unscripted exploaratory testing which is the first part of the lab or unscripted which is the second part of the lab. Unscripted testing is doing testing where you do whatever you want to test out whether the functionality of the system bugs. Scripted testing is a pre-planned testing format where you have specific actions to setup the test and specific functions to be tested. Then with regression testing we understand that it is a repeat test of previous bugs that are found during your previous either manual or unit testing. 

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

We are going to test each of the ATM functions using both card 1 and card 2 interacting with each of the available accounts to interact with. Then we will be testing if the system. Testing if there is good error handling like if they put in a wrong card number or the wrong password for a card.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Benefits:
Exploratory testing is a great tool to start testing with and to familiarize yourself with the functions of a system but more testing should be done to conclude that there are no errors in the system.

Manual function testing is a great tool when you know all of the functionalities of a system that you would like to test as you can build out a predefined script that is going to cover all of the functionalities that the system needs.

Efficiency:
Exploratory testing is more efficient than manual scripted testing as with exploratory testing your are able to right away go into the system and test all of the functionalities that you can see without having to build a script out like you do in manual function testing.

Coverage:
In exploratory testing it is alot harder to know that you have done a full coverage of testing for the system without a script of all the functions that you should be testing and what to do for those tests. For manual function testing you have a script and it is really easy to build out that script to include all functionality that you wish to test without having to make a high level plan. Manual function testing has better coverage than exploratory.

Tradeoffs:

As explained before the big tradeoff between manual function testing and exploratory testing is that exploratory testing is faster to get completed but the coverage of this testing is often unknown. While manual function testing is less efficient speed wise there is a predefined amount of coverage that you are going to get as you are making a script for your testing before you actually test anything.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
